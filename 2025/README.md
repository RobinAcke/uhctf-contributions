# 2025 Edition

For the 2025 edition, I came up with a more fun idea: making 1 big, themed challenge that contains a set of smaller challenges. Finishing all the small challenges, unlocks the final "main" challenge.

As this was my biggest challenge to date, I decided to only make this set of challenges. In the end I also added 1 more small challenge for fun which only took 20 minutes to create, but was still a success during the competition.

## Neon Rebellion

This is my biggest challenge to date. It mainly focuses on basic web forensics and puzzle elements rather than pure cyber security, although some relevant concepts are touched upon in the smaller challenges.

The bigger challenge incorporates an interesting find from the smaller challenges into a semi-realistic scenario of endpoints that could be leveraged to find the final flag.

For the theming, I went a bit crazy. I knew I wanted some neon elements to make it look like a funky, retro website. I ended up going with a "schizophrenic" hacker who sees conspiracy theories everywhere, and wrote a manifesto accusing some shady government of continuing the MK Ultra project.

## Out of Order

The idea of this challenge is very simple: sort all lines of a small piece of code alphabetically and give the code to participants to figure out. I came up with it 3 day before the CTF while I was programming something totally different and accidently ran the sorting command in my IDE (instead of running my unit tests).
