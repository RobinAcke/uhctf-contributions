# 2024 Edition

My first ever CTF as an organizer instead of as a participant. I had a lot of fun organizing both the logistics side of the event, as well as contributing multiple challenges to the competition itself.

I did unfortunately make a mistake in "Neos Dual Secrets" part 2 which made it trivially solvable compared to the intended solution. Lessons were learned! Always try to get some 3rd party testing and do some "sanity checks" for cheese solutions on complexer challenges...

I also learned how janky most CTF challenges are behind the scenes; absolutely terrible/unreadable code that is honestly embarrassing to push. But hey, as long as the participants enjoy a challenge it is a great success!

## Parseltongue

Unfortunately I chose a Harry Potter themed challenge, which I since regretted due to questionable actions and statements by the author. However, the challenge itself was fun to make and solve. It relies on a realistic exploit, and teaches the participants about the actual importance of patching older software to avoid security flaws!

## QRyptic Clues

Since this is a physical event, I thought it would be fun to make use of this opportunity to hide some QR codes throughout the venue. A lot of partcipants have indicated that they really loved the uniqueness of this challenge, so I was very happy I took the gamble on adding a non-security "puzzle" to the CTF!

## YouShallNotPitch

A simple steganography challenge combining a few stego techniques.

## Neos Dual Secrets

The abbreviation of this challenge (NDS) is a hint to what it is: a nintendo DS game! The competitors have to figure this out for the first part, and cheat in said game to win in the second part.

Unfortunately I tried to be too cool with an ascii art flag in the second part, which resulted in some participants solving the challenge without cheating in the game! But at least 1 participant took the intended route of manipulating the memory, so I am happy at least 1 person learned how to cheat in DS games that day.

I never created any sort of homebrew applications before, so it was an interesting experience (with some crappy code and creative problem solving) to write software for the Nintendo DS in this context.
